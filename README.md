# Forked

I forked from [mobluse/convoy-bomb](https://github.com/mobluse/convoy-bomb)

# Goal 

Just keep the drop idea, but make it very different, using Unicode chars as graphical sprites.

I would also keep the original game translated in English and maybe improve it too.

In both cases, I assume risk of restricting code to gnu-forth & Unicode capable terminal compatibility only.
